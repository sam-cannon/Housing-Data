# Housing-Data
This code is from my best submission to the advanced regression Ames, Iowa housing data competition. 
I scored a Root Mean Squared Log Error of .12647 while the top 10 started at .10581, which landed me in the top 36%, this was a 
tight competition!

# This competition allowed me to play with a few different ways of averaging algorithms as well as creating features. It was also 
really cool to discover missingno, which helps to visualize missing data, and yellowbrickroad, which helps in visualizing residuals of 
regression predictions. If anyone has any questions about my code please email me at fultoncannon@gmail.com
